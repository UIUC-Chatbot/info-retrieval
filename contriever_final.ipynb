However, the converse need not be true.  A representation can\\nhave several bit patterns representing the same value, and\\nnot all bit patterns in a representation need be\\nused to represent values.\\n\\nLet's consider a few example of representations with unused patterns.\\nHistorically, one common class of representations of this type was \\nthose used to represent individual decimal digits.  We examine three\\nexamples from this class.\\n\\nThe first is Binary-coded Decimal (BCD), in which\\ndecimal digits are encoded individually \\nusing their representations in the unsigned\\n(binary) representation.  Since we have 10 decimal digits, we need \\n10 patterns, and four bits for each digit.  But four bits allow \\n2^4=16 bit patterns.  In BCD, the patterns 1010,1011,,1111\\nare unused.  It is important to note that BCD is not the same as the\\nunsigned representation.  The decimal number 732, for example, requires 12 bits\\nwhen encoded as BCD: 0111 0011 0010.  When written using a {12-bit}\\nunsigned representation, 732 is written 001011011100.  Operations\\non BCD values were implemented in early processors, including the\\n8086, and are thus still available in the x86 instruction set architecture\\ntoday!\\n\\n\\nThe second example is an {Excess-3} code, in which each decimal\\ndigit d is represented by the pattern corresponding to the \\n{4-bit} unsigned pattern for d+3.  For example, the digit 4\\nis represented as 0111, and the digit 7 is represented as 1010.\\nThe {Excess-3} code has some attractive aspects when using \\nsimple hardware.  For example, we can use a {4-bit} binary \\nadder to add two digits c and d represented in the {Excess-3} code, \\nand the carry out signal produced by the adder is the same as the carry\\nout for the decimal addition, since c+d is equivalent to \\n(c+3)+(d+3).\\n\\nThe third example of decimal digit representations is a {2-out-of-5}\\ncode.  In such a code, five bits are used to encode each digit.  \\n\\nOnly patterns with exactly two 1s are used.  There are exactly ten \\nsuch patterns, and an example representation is shown to the right (more\\nthan one assignment of values to patterns has been used in real systems).\\n\\n\\n{c|c}\\n& a 2-out-of-5\\ndigit& representation \\n1& 00011\\n2& 00101\\n3& 00110\\n4& 01001\\n5& 01010\\n6& 01100\\n7& 10001\\n8& 10010\\n9& 10100\\n0& 11000\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 3: \"{Example: A Three-Bit Gray Code Counter}\\n\\n\\nNow we'll add a third bit to our counter, but again use a Gray code\\nas the basis for the state sequence.\\n\\nA fully-specified transition diagram for such a counter appears to \\nthe right.  As before, with no inputs, the states simply form a loop, \\nwith the counter moving from one state to the next each cycle.\\n\\nEach state in the diagram is marked with the internal state value S_2S_1S_0 \\n(before ``/'') and the output Z_2Z_1Z_0 (after ``/''). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBased on the transition diagram, we can fill in the K-maps for the \\nnext-state values S_2^+, S_1^+, and S_0^+ as shown to the right, then \\nderive algebraic expressions.  The results are more complex this \\ntime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor our next-state logic, we obtain:\\n{eqnarray*}\\nS_2^+ &=& S_2 S_0 + S_1 {{S_0}} \\nS_1^+ &=& {{S_2}} S_0 + S_1 {{S_0}} \\nS_0^+ &=& {{S_2}} {{S_1}} + S_2 S_1\\n{eqnarray*}\\n\\n\\nNotice that the equations for S_2^+ and S_1^+ share a common term,\\nS_1{{S_0}}.\\n\\nThis design does not allow much choice in developing good equations for\\nthe next-state logic, but some designs may enable you to reduce \\nthe design complexity by explicitly identifying and making use of \\ncommon algebraic terms and sub-expressions for different outputs.\\nIn modern design processes, identifying such opportunities is generally\\nperformed by a computer program, but it's important to understand\\nhow they arise.  Note that the common term becomes a single AND gate\\nin the implementation of our counter, as shown to the right.\\n\\nLooking at the counter's implementation diagram, notice that the vertical\\nlines carrying the current state values and their inverses back to the\\nnext state\\nlogic inputs have been carefully ordered to simplify\\nunderstanding the diagram.  In particular, they are ordered from\\nleft to right (on the left side of the figure) as \\n{{S_0}}S_0{{S_1}}S_1{{S_2}}S_2.\\nWhen designing any logic diagram, be sure to make use of a reasonable\\norder so as to make it easy for someone (including yourself!) to read \\nand check the correctness of the logic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 11: \"{Impact of the State Representation}\\n\\nWhat happens if we choose a bad representation?

A counter in which all flip-flops do \\nutilize the same clock\\nsignal is called a { synchronous counter}.  \\n\\nExcept for a brief introduction to other types of counters in the\\nnext section, our class focuses entirely on clocked synchronous designs,\\nincluding counters.\\n\\n {The definition ignores transition\\n arcs resulting from functionalit such as a reset signal that\\n forces the counter back into an initial state, \\n\\n\\nThe design of synchronous counter circuits is a fairly straightforward\\nexercise given the desired cycle of output patterns. \\n\\nThe task can be more complex if the internal state bits\\nare allowed to differ from the output bits, so for now\\nwe assume that output Z_i is equal to internal bit S_i.\\nNote that distinction between internal states and outputs is necessary \\nif any output pattern appears more than once in the desired cycle. \\n\\nThe cycle of states shown to the right corresponds to the\\nstates of a {3-bit} binary counter.  The numbers in the states\\nrepresent both internal state bits S_2S_1S_0 and output bits Z_2Z_1Z_0.\\nWe transcribe this diagram into the next-state table shown on the left below.\\nWe then write out {K-maps} for\\nthe next state bits S_2^+, S_1^+, and S_0^+, as shown to the right,\\nand use the {K-maps} to find expressions for these variables in\\nterms of the current state.\\n\\n\\n{file=part3/figs/lec16-9.eps,width=1.5in}\\n\\n\\n{\\n\\n{ccc|ccc}\\nS_2& S_1& S_0& S_2^+& S_1^+& S_0^+ \\n0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 1\\n0& 0& 1& 0& 1& 0\\n0& 1& 0& 0& 1& 1\\n0& 1& 1& 1& 0& 0\\n1& 0& 0& 1& 0& 1\\n1& 0& 1& 1& 1& 0\\n1& 1& 0& 1& 1& 1\\n1& 1& 1& 0& 0& 0\\n\\n\\n\\n{file=part3/figs/sbin3-s2.eps,width=1in}\\n{file=part3/figs/sbin3-s1.eps,width=1in}\\n{file=part3/figs/sbin3-s0.eps,width=1in} {-10pt}\\n{eqnarray*}\\nS_2^+ =& {S_2}S_1S_0+S_2{S_1}+S_2{S_0} &= S_2(S_1S_0) \\nS_1^+ =& S_1{S_0}+{S_1}S_0 &= S_1{S_0} \\nS_0^+ =& {S_0} &= S_0 \\n{eqnarray*}\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe first form of the expression for each next-state variable is\\ntaken directly from the corresponding {K-map}.  We have rewritten\\neach expression to make the emerging pattern more obvious.\\n\\nWe can also derive the pattern intuitively by asking the following:\\n\\ngiven a binary counter in state S_{N-1}S_{N-2} S_{j+1}S_jS_{j-1}\\nS_1S_0, when does S_j change in the subsequent state?  The answer,\\nof course, is that S_j changes when all of the\\nbits below S_j are 1.  Otherwise, S_j remains the\\nsame in the next state.  We thus \\nwrite S_j^+=S_j (S_{j-1} S_1S_0) and\\nimplement the counter as shown below for a {4-bit} design.\\nNote that the \\nusual order of\\noutput bits along the bottom is reversed in the figure, with the most\\nsignificant bit at the right rather than the left.\\n\\n{{file=part3/figs/ser-gating.eps,width=4.5in}}\\n\\nThe calculation of the left inputs to the XOR gates in the counter \\nshown above is performed with a series of two-input AND gates.  Each \\nof these gates AND's\\nanother flip-flop value into the product.  This\\napproach, called { serial gating}, implies that an {N-bit}\\ncounter requires more than {N-2} gate delays\\nto settle into the next state.  An alternative approach, called\\n{ parallel gating}, calculates each input independently with a\\nsingle logic gate, as shown below.  The blue inputs to the AND gate\\nfor S_3 highlight the difference from the previous figure (note that\\nthe two approaches differ only for bits S_3 and above).\\nWith parallel gating, the \\n{ fan-in} of the gates (the number of inputs)\\nand the { fan-out} of the flip-flop outputs (number of other gates\\ninto which an output feeds) grow with the size of the counter.  \\nIn practice, large counters use a combination of these two approaches.\\n\\n{{file=part3/figs/par-gating.eps,width=4.5in}}\\n\\n\\n\", 3: \"{Example: A Three-Bit Gray Code Counter}\\n\\n\\nNow we'll add a third bit to our counter, but again use a Gray code\\nas the basis for the state sequence.\\n\\nA fully-specified transition diagram for such a counter appears to \\nthe right.  As before, with no inputs, the states simply form a loop, \\nwith the counter moving from one state to the next each cycle.\\n\\nEach state in the diagram is marked with the internal state value S_2S_1S_0 \\n(before ``/'') and the output Z_2Z_1Z_0 (after ``/''). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBased on the transition diagram, we can fill in the K-maps for the \\nnext-state values S_2^+, S_1^+, and S_0^+ as shown to the right, then \\nderive algebraic expressions.  The results are more complex this \\ntime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor our next-state logic, we obtain:\\n{eqnarray*}\\nS_2^+ &=& S_2 S_0 + S_1 {{S_0}} \\nS_1^+ &=& {{S_2}} S_0 + S_1 {{S_0}} \\nS_0^+ &=& {{S_2}} {{S_1}} + S_2 S_1\\n{eqnarray*}\\n\\n\\nNotice that the equations for S_2^+ and S_1^+ share a common term,\\nS_1{{S_0}}.\\n\\nThis design does not allow much choice in developing good equations for\\nthe next-state logic, but some designs may enable you to reduce \\nthe design complexity by explicitly identifying and making use of \\ncommon algebraic terms and sub-expressions for different outputs.\\nIn modern design processes, identifying such opportunities is generally\\nperformed by a computer program, but it's important to understand\\nhow they arise.  Note that the common term becomes a single AND gate\\nin the implementation of our counter, as shown to the right.\\n\\nLooking at the counter's implementation diagram, notice that the vertical\\nlines carrying the current state values and their inverses back to the\\nnext state\\nlogic inputs have been carefully ordered to simplify\\nunderstanding the diagram.  In particular, they are ordered from\\nleft to right (on the left side of the figure) as \\n{{S_0}}S_0{{S_1}}S_1{{S_2}}S_2.\\nWhen designing any logic diagram, be sure to make use of a reasonable\\norder so as to make it easy for someone (including yourself!) to read \\nand check the correctness of the logic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 33: \"{State Representation and Logic Expressions}\\n\\nLet's think about the representation for the FSM states.  The FSM has \\nfive states, so we could use as few as three flip-flops.  Instead, we choose\\nto use a { one-hot encoding}, in which any valid bit pattern has exactly\\none 1 bit.  In other words, we use five flip-flops instead of three,\\nand our states are represented with the bit patterns 10000, 01000, 00100,\\n00010, and 00001.\\n\\nThe table below shows the mapping from each high-level state to \\nboth the five-bit encoding for the state as well as the six control signals \\nneeded for the datapath.  For each state, the values of the control signals\\ncan be found by examining the actions necessary in that state.\\n\\n{\\n{|c|c|cccccc|}\\nstate& { S_4S_3S_2S_1S_0}& { IDX.RST}& { IDX.CNT}& { MIN.LD}& { A.LD}& { B.LD}& { CNT.RST} \\n{ WAIT}& { 1 0 0 0 0}& 1& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0\\n{ INIT}& { 0 1 0 0 0}& 0& 1& 1& 0& 0& 0\\n{ PREP}& { 0 0 1 0 0}& 0& 0& 0& 1& 1& 1\\n{ COMPARE}& { 0 0 0 1 0}& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0\\n{ COPY}& { 0 0 0 0 1}& 0& 1& { THEN}& 0& 0& 0 \\n{}\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe { WAIT} state needs to set { IDX} to 0 but need not affect \\nother register or counter values, so { WAIT} produces a 1 only for\\n{ IDX.RST}.  The { INIT} state needs to load { values[0]} into \\nthe { MIN} register while simultaneously incrementing the { IDX}\\ncounter (from 0 to 1), so { INIT} produces 1s for { IDX.CNT}\\nand { MIN.LD}.  The { PREP} state loads both shift registers\\nand resets the counter { CNT} by producing 1s for { A.LD},\\n{ B.LD}, and { CNT.RST}.  The { COMPARE} state does not\\nchange any register values, so it produces all 0s.  Finally, the { COPY}\\nstate increments the { IDX} counter while simultaneously loading a\\nnew value into the { MIN} register.  The { COPY} state produces 1\\nfor { IDX.CNT}, but must use the signal { THEN} coming from the\\ndatapath to decide whether or not { MIN} is loaded.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe advantage of a one-hot encoding becomes obvious when we write\\nequations for the six control signals and the next-state logic, as shown\\nto the right.  \\n\\nImplementing the logic to complete our design now requires only a handful \\nof small logic gates.\\n\\n\\n{eqnarray*}\\n{ IDX.RST} & = & { S}_4\\n{ IDX.CNT} & = & { S}_3 + { S}_0\\n{ MIN.LD} & = & { S}_3 + { S}_0  { THEN}\\n{ A.LD} & = & { S}_2\\n{ B.LD} & = & { S}_2\\n{ CNT.RST} & = & { S}_2\\n{eqnarray*}\\n\\n\\n{eqnarray*}\\n{ S}_4^+ & = & { S}_4  { START} + { S}_0  { DONE}\\n{ S}_3^+ & = & { S}_4  { START}\\n{ S}_2^+ & = & { S}_3 + { S}_0  { DONE}\\n{ S}_1^+ & = & { S}_2 + { S}_1  { LAST}\\n{ S}_0^+ & = & { S}_1  { LAST}\\n{eqnarray*}\\n\\n\\nNotice that the terms in each control signal can be read directly from \\nthe rows of the state table and OR'd together.  The terms in each of the\\nnext-state equations represent the incoming arcs for the corresponding\\nstate.  For example, the { WAIT} state has one self-loop (the first\\nterm) and a transition arc coming from the { COPY} state when the\\nloop is done.\\n\\nThese expressions complete our design.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}\n"
